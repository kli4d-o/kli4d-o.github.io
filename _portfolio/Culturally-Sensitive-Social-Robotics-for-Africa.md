Respectful human-robot interaction is informed by local culture. This is a project to equip Pepper humanoid social robots with the ability to interact verbally and non-verbally with people in Rwanda and South Africa in a culturally sensitive manner. We have already acquired Rwandan cultural knowledge by means of an online survey, targeting spatial, verbal, and non-verbal communication. Each type of knowledge in the survey is structured using a cultural knowledge ontology. We are now developing a system that embeds this cultural knowledge in a Pepper robot that gives visitors a short tour of a robotics laboratory. The system is being implemented in the Robot Operating System (ROS) by developing a package of ROS nodes that provide functionality for overt attention (based on detection and localization of sounds, people, and faces), speech understanding and production, animate behavior, deictic, iconic, and symbolic gesture, and navigation. The robot mission is coordinated by a ROS behavior controller node that interprets the lab tour use case scenario specified by a behavior tree.
