This project involved the development of an AI agent that uses the GPT-4o LLM to allow a human user to give high level tasks to a humanoid robot using natural language. The agent interfaces with the Cognitive Robot Abstract Machine (CRAM) platform, which generates the low-level robot actions that guide the robot’s actuation when fulfilling the human user’s high level task.

This is the capstone project done to fulfill the requirements of the Engineering Artificial Intelligence programme at CMU-Africa for the graduating class of 2025. All capstone groups had to undertake a project involving the application of LLMs in an engineering domain, and we chose robotics as the domain of our interest.
