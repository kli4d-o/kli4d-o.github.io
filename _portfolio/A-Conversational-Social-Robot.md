This project involves training a neural network that takes as input a string of text, and outputs gestures to be performed by a robot. The robot is to perform these gestures while speaking out the text that was passed as input to the neural network. The aim is to have a conversational robot that uses gestures as non-verbal cues to accompany the words it is speaking.
