This project was inspired by NVIDIA’s STRIVE, which uses a graph-based conditional VAE to model traffic motion. Pertubations in the latent space of this conditional VAE are used to generate trajectories of vehicles in a scene such as to cause a challenging scenario for an ego vehicle. We experimented with different encoder architectures to determine their efficacy in improving the conditional VAE’s generation of trajectories that are both challenging and realistic.

This project was done as part of a class project in the course Principles and Engineering Applications of AI.
