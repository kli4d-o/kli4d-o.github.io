At times, a need arises to distribute shares of a secret among several parties in such a way that the secret is hidden from the parties to whom it has been distributed, and can only be accessed when these parties collaborate to aggregate their shares of the distributed secret. This is the problem of secret sharing, and many diverse solutions have been suggested for it.

In this research project, we explore an approach to threshold secret sharing where one participant holds a key that is used to recover the original secret whenever the threshold number of participants required to recreate the secret is reached. Without the key, the rest of the participants cannot recreate the secret even when they exceed the threshold required to recreate the secret, and neither can the participant with the key recreate the secret when the threshold number of participants has not been attained.
