This is a [presentation](https://cssr4africa.github.io/presentations/2024_Robotics_in_Africa_Forum_IROS_Jimoh_et_al_lightning_presentation.pdf) given in the [Robotics in Africa Forum](https://africarobotics.github.io/iros2024/) at [IROS 2024](https://iros2024-abudhabi.org/) on the use of behavior trees to control the behavior of culturally sensitivity social robots.

Behavior trees offer a structured and modular approach to managing complex robot behaviors, enabling dynamic adaptation to different cultural contexts. We presented a framework for incorporating cultural sensitivity into behavior trees, detailing the process of identifying cultural norms, modeling behaviors, and implementing dynamic adaptation mechanisms. We wrapped up the presentation by demonstrating this approach through a case study , where the robot’s interactions are tailored to respect and respond appropriately to the cultural norm of the Rwandan culture.
